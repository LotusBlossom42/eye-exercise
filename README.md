# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes
This is the literal manifestation of Rockwell's "Somebody's Watching Me" and "Private Eyes" by Hall & Oates.
Move your mouse around the page, and watch these eyes follow its every move.

## How to Run
Clone this repo locally and drag and drop the index.html file into the address bar of your browser. 
Hit enter and you should feel very seen with two googly eyes checkin' you out. 

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
Something great and simplistically creepy about just two eyes on the page, but never the less, 
I might want to turn it into a creature, or have multiple sets of eyes in different areas of the page-
kind of like animal eyes in the dead of night, out in the wild. 
In that vein, I might want to add blinking functionality and nocturnal sounds to mimic the wild at night.
